# Complete Reference Software Analysis - LASANI LOGISTICS

## Current Status: Manual Exploration Required

Due to the complexity of the reference software's menu structure and the need for comprehensive analysis, I recommend the following approach:

## Step 1: Manual Menu Exploration Checklist

Please manually explore the reference software and document:

### LOGISTICS Menu
- [ ] Click on "Logistics" menu
- [ ] List all sub-menu items
- [ ] For each sub-menu, list all options/forms
- [ ] Document workflows

### LOGISTICS REPORTS Menu  
- [ ] Click on "Logistics Reports" menu
- [ ] List all report options
- [ ] Document report parameters/filters
- [ ] Document output formats

### FINANCE Menu
- [ ] Click on "Finance" menu
- [ ] List all sub-menu items
- [ ] Document forms and workflows

### FINANCE REPORTS Menu
- [ ] Click on "Finance Reports" menu
- [ ] List all report options
- [ ] Document report types

### PAYROLL Menu
- [ ] Click on "Payroll" menu
- [ ] List all sub-menu items
- [ ] Document workflows

### PAYROLL REPORTS Menu
- [ ] Click on "Payroll Reports" menu
- [ ] List all report options

### SYSTEM Menu
- [ ] Click on "System" menu
- [ ] List all system settings/options
- [ ] Document user management features

## Step 2: Comparison & Action Plan

Once menu structure is documented:
1. Compare with current implementation
2. Remove features not in reference
3. Add missing features
4. Reorganize menus to match reference

## Current Implementation Summary

### Current Menus:
- S2E Logistics (Initial Setup, CN Entry, Load Plans, Delivery Sheets, Pickup Sheets, Invoices)
- Logistics Reports (Sales, Profit/Loss, CN Status, Control Lists)
- Finance (Chart of Accounts, Vouchers, Trial Balance, Balance Sheet, Profit & Loss)
- Payroll (Departments, Designations, Employees, Process Payroll)
- Settings (Users, Roles, Permissions, Audit Logs)

### Key Differences Noted:
- Reference has separate "Finance Reports" menu (current combines Finance & Reports)
- Reference has separate "Payroll Reports" menu (current doesn't have this)
- Reference has "System" menu (current has "Settings")
- Need to verify exact menu items match
